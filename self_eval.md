# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
When you're dealing with booleans or true or false statements and you want to incorporate them into code. 

2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I wouldn't do anything differently, besides maybe ask for help when I get stuck instead of pondering for an hour or more. 

3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
How easily I can recall making conditional statements. I had a rough time with it my last Mod 0 go around, and I'm glad to see I'm grasping it.
