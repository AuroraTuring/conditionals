# More Practice: Logical Operators with Conditions
# Declare a variable that stores a password. In order for a password to be valid, it needs to have 8 characters or more and include the symbol #. Use logical operators and conditions to give the user feedback based on their password. If the user enters a password that is both 8 characters or more and includes the symbol #, print the statement, "Got it. Your password is: XXXXXXXX" using interpolation to confirm their password.
