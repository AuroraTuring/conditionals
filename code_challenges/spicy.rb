# Write a Ruby program that prints out a String or Integer: The printed value will depend on the value of an Integer. If the Integer is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz". If the Integer is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz". If the Integer is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz". If the Integer is not a multiple of either, print the Integer itself.


age = 31 

if age = x3 
  print "Fizz"
elsif age = x5 
  print "Buzz"
elsif age = x3 && age = x5 
  print "FizzBuzz"
else
  print age
end
